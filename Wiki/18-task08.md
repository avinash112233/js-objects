# Object Exercise 8

How to work with properties of an object

Open file named **task08.js**. Inside it, write your code in a function and then finally export it.

Given below is an array of objects stored in variable __obj__. Your have to create a function
 with one argument an object which will return an array containing all
the values of __title__ property of that element from the array object whose `isDone`
 value is `true`.
Return the resulting values in an output variable

Given below is the format of the object which will be passed as the argument.

```js
var obj = [
  {
    title: "buy meal",
    isDone: false
  },
  {
    title: "come office on time",
    isDone: false
  },
  {
    title: ["BMW", "Mercedez", "maruti"],
    isDone: true
  }
];
```

Hint:

- Create a new variable and assign an empty array
- Return the result in the output variable
